                  <img src="images/grace-hopper.jpg" />
                    <p>Grace Hopper, the pioneer of STEM, charted a course which has encouraged women to follow  the proverbial, "road less traveled."  Although women are still making inroads into the STEM industry, we have a come a long way.

                    <p>As reported by the Department of Labor (2015), <q>While women make up nearly half of the workforce, they make up only 26 percent of STEM workers. Though progress has been made in the fields of math and science, women remain significantly underrepresented in engineering and information technology.</q></p>
                    <p>Women must seek out technical training opportunities to discover their technical niche.  Women centric events sponsored by Meetup provide opportunities for women to network and to innovate.  Please see the events link for upcoming events.</p>
